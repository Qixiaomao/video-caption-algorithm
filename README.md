# Video Captioning System Based on ViT and GPT-2

This repository contains the implementation code for the paper: **"Design and Implementation of a Multi-Modal Video Captioning System Based on ViT and GPT-2"**.

## 📂 Project Structure
(这里简单解释一下你那些乱七八糟的文件夹是干嘛的，显得很有条理)
- `src/`: Core implementation of the video captioning model.
- `scripts/`: Experimental scripts for data preprocessing and testing.
- `Ui/`: Front-end interface code (Chainlit/React).
- `tools/`: Utility scripts for video frame extraction.

## ⚠️ Note on Pre-trained Models and Datasets
Due to GitHub's file size limits, the **pre-trained model weights (checkpoints)** and **large video datasets** are NOT included in this repository.
- **Checkpoints:** The system relies on ViT and GPT-2 weights.
- **Data:** The training data (e.g., MSVD/MSR-VTT) is excluded.


## Video Captioning System with ViT + GPT-2 and Chainlit Front-end

This repository contains the full implementation of my Master's graduation project:  
**An end-to-end Video Captioning System integrating a ViT-based video encoder, GPT-2 text decoder, and a Chainlit-powered front-end for interactive inference.**

The project provides:
- A complete video captioning model  
- Data preprocessing pipeline  
- Training and evaluation scripts  
- A user-friendly Chainlit demo interface  
- Human evaluation results for caption quality

🤖 Inference (CLI)

Example:

```c:
python src/cli/inference.py \
    --video_path example.mp4 \
    --checkpoint outputs/checkpoints/best.ckpt \
    --num_frames 16

```


Outputs:

```css:
Generated caption: "A woman is preparing food in the kitchen."
```

📊 Human Evaluation

A human evaluation survey was conducted using 4 criteria:

**Fluency,Relevance,Specificity,Overall Preference**

Example summary results:

| Criterion          | Avg. Score |
| ------------------ | ---------- |
| Fluency            | 3.38       |
| Relevance          | 2.63       |
| Specificity        | 3.25       |
| Overall Preference | 4.00       |

💬 Chainlit Demo (Front-end)

To launch the interactive UI:
```c:
chainlit run Ui/app_chainlit.py -w
```


Then open the local URL shown in the terminal.

In the UI, you can:

Select an inference engine

Paste a video frame directory path

Generate captions interactively


---
🔍 TODO

- Add support for audio-based captioning

- Extend dataset to MSR-VTT

- Improve Chainlit UI for video uploading

- Add BLEU/ROUGE automatic metrics to the demo

- Deploy model via FastAPI backend
